Quick notes:  
- This software is on license: **Apache v2.0**  
- If you want to speed up puting up boards activate pasting in your cmd by shortcut ctrl+shift+v and copy first 10 lines from saved games.  
- As of now this version works only on windows and I probably won't add port for linux.  
Enjoy!!!
